# student-assistant-system
This is a student assistant system made by me and a classmate of mine for my first semester project as part of the Fundamentals of Programming course in my first year at university. 

The idea behind this was pretty basic and the course itself was the first one in which I really got to programme something of this scale.
The features include:
- A scheduler
- A to-do list
- GPA Calculator
- Motivational Quote Generator
- Budgeter

It is entirely done in C and runs on the terminal, however it does have different colours that give it a nice touch.
